The AI-driven chatbot solution deployed on this hardware platform utilizes a highly efficient, open-source language model optimized for edge computing, alongside a suite of supporting software components.

Language Model: • Parameter Size: Approximately 2–7 billion parameters, ensuring a balance between performance and resource efficiency.

• Precision: Supports 4-bit quantization (e.g. , INT8 or GGUF format) to fit within the 8 GB RAM constraint while maintaining quality.

• Context Window: Configurable up to 4096–8192 tokens (~3000–6000 words, equivalent to 10–20 pages of A4 text), enabling robust handling of enterprise knowledge bases.

• Performance: Capable of generating 5–10 tokens per second during inference, suitable for sequential processing of user queries.

• Licensing: Fully open-source with permissive licensing (e.g. , MIT or Apache 2.0), allowing unrestricted use, modification, and deployment within organizational networks.

Additional Software Components: • Inference Engine: A lightweight runtime environment optimized for GPU acceleration, leveraging CUDA and tensor core capabilities to maximize inference speed on the hardware.

• Text Processing Framework: A modular toolkit for tokenization, embedding generation, and text preprocessing, enabling seamless integration of enterprise-specific datasets into the model's knowledge base.

• Knowledge Base Integration: A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that indexes and retrieves relevant textual data from an external storage medium (e.g. , microSD or NVMe), supporting up to 500 GB of unstructured text data (approximately 200 million A4 pages).

• Networking Layer: A secure, local server framework (e.g. , RESTful API) for handling user queries within the enterprise intranet, ensuring data privacy and low-latency responses.

• Installation Requirements: Compatible with a Linux-based operating system, requiring approximately 20–50 GB of storage for the OS, model weights, and supporting libraries.
