Specification of the AI Model and Additional Software
The AI-driven platform employs an advanced, open-source machine learning model and a suite of supporting software tailored for intelligent automation, text-based interactions, and voice assistance. Below is a depersonalized specification reflecting the system's capabilities without identifying specific vendors or developers:
•	Machine Learning Model: 
o	Parameter Size: Approximately 13–20 billion parameters, providing robust performance for automation, natural language understanding, and generation tasks. 
o	Precision: Supports mixed precision (e.g., FP16 or 4-bit quantization like INT8), optimizing memory usage within the 24 GB GDDR6X constraint while maintaining high throughput. 
o	Context Window: Configurable up to 16,384–65,536 tokens (~12,000–48,000 words, equivalent to 40–160 A4 pages), enabling deep contextual analysis for automation workflows and multi-turn dialogues. 
o	Performance: Capable of generating 30–60 tokens per second during inference, supporting real-time text and voice interactions with low latency. 
o	Multimodal Capabilities: Integrates speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) with processing latencies of 0.3–0.8 seconds for STT and <150 ms for TTS, facilitating seamless voice-driven automation. 
o	Licensing: Fully open-source with permissive licensing (e.g., MIT or Apache 2.0), allowing unrestricted enterprise customization and deployment.
•	Additional Software Components: 
o	Inference Engine: A GPU-accelerated runtime leveraging CUDA and Tensor Cores for high-speed inference, optimized for the Ada Lovelace architecture to maximize automation and chatbot performance. 
o	Automation Framework: A modular system for designing, executing, and monitoring workflows, capable of integrating with enterprise APIs, robotic process automation (RPA), and IoT devices for end-to-end process automation. 
o	Speech Processing Framework: A real-time audio processing suite for STT and TTS, supporting multilingual inputs and customizable voice outputs for voice assistant functionality. 
o	Knowledge Base Integration: A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system indexing up to 2 TB of unstructured data (~800 million A4 pages), enabling dynamic access to enterprise repositories for automation and query resolution. 
o	Networking Layer: A secure, local server framework (e.g., RESTful or WebSocket API) for handling text, voice, and automation requests within an enterprise intranet, ensuring privacy and scalability. 
o	Installation Requirements: Compatible with a Linux-based OS (e.g., Ubuntu), requiring ~50–100 GB of storage for the OS, model weights, automation scripts, and libraries.
This configuration supports a versatile platform for intelligent automation, combining process orchestration, chatbot interactions, and voice assistance with high computational efficiency and enterprise-grade adaptability.
