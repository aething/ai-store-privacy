## Issue Prioritization

Prioritize issues by the following criteria:
1. **Critical**: Prevents core functionality, crashes, or security vulnerabilities
2. **High**: Significant impact on user experience but with workarounds
3. **Medium**: Minor functional issues with easy workarounds
4. **Low**: Cosmetic issues, minor UI inconsistencies

All critical and high-priority issues must be resolved before submission to Google Play Store.
